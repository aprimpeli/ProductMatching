      "description":"iPhone 6 is perfect in every way. Large, yet dramatically thin. Powerful, but remarkably power efficient. With a smooth metal surface that seamlessly meets the Retina HD display. It’s one continuous form where hardware and software function in perfect unison. Developing an iPhone with a larger, more advanced display meant pushing the edge of design. From the seamless transition of glass and metal to the streamlined profile, every detail was carefully considered to enhance your experience. So while its display is larger, iPhone 6 feels just right. It's one thing to make a bigger display. It's something else entirely to make a bigger multitouch display with brilliant colors and higher contrast at even wider viewing angles. But that's exactly about the Retina HD display. Built on 64-bit desktop-class architecture, the A8 chip delivers more power, even while driving a larger display. The M8 motion coprocessor efficiently gathers data from advanced sensors and a barometer. And with increased battery life, iPhone 6 lets you do more, for longer than ever. More people take more photos with iPhone than with any other camera. And now the iSight camera has a sensor with Focus Pixels and amazing video features, like 1080p HD at 60 fps, slo-mo at 240 fps, and time-lapse video mode. So you'll have more reasons to capture more moments on video, too. iPhone 6 has faster LTE download speeds, and it supports more LTE bands than any other smartphone so you can roam in more places. And when connected to Wi-Fi, you'll get up to 3x faster speeds. The breakthrough Touch ID technology lets you securely access your iPhone with the perfect password: your fingerprint.",

      "description":"While everyone else was busy trying to keep up with iPhone, Apple were busy creating amazing new features that make iPhone more powerful, easier to use, and more indispensable than ever. The result is iPhone 4. The biggest thing to happen to iPhone since iPhone. All the breakthrough technology in iPhone 4 is situated between two glossy panels of aluminosilicate glass - the same type of glass used in the windshields of helicopters and high-speed trains. Chemically strengthened to be 20 times stiffer and 30 times harder than plastic, the glass is ultradurable and more scratch resistant than ever. It's also recyclable. The 960-by-640 backlit LCD display boasts a pixel density of 326 pixels per inch, making it the highest-resolution phone screen ever. To achieve this, Apple engineers developed pixels so small - a mere 78 micrometers across - that the human eye can't distinguish individual pixels. That makes text remarkably sharp and graphics incredibly vivid. IPS technology also provides excellent color and contrast from almost any viewing angle. Created from Apple's own alloy, then forged to be five times stronger than standard steel, the CNC-machined band is the mounting point for all the components of iPhone 4. The band provides impressive structural rigidity and allows for its incredibly thin, refined design. It also functions as both iPhone 4 antennas. Apple engineers designed the A4 chip to be a remarkably powerful yet remarkably power-efficient mobile processor. With it, iPhone 4 can easily perform complex jobs such as multitasking, editing video, and placing FaceTime calls. All while maximizing battery life. iPhone 4 includes a built-in three-axis gyroscope. When paired with the accelerometer, it makes iPhone 4 capable of advanced motion sensing such as user acceleration, full 3D attitude, and rotation rate. Translation: More motion gestures and greater precision for an even better gaming experience. The iPhone 4 camera shoots gorgeous 5-megapixel photos and stunning HD video. And with its advanced backside illumination sensor, it captures beautiful images even in low-light settings. The built-in LED flash does double duty. When you're taking pictures, it works as a flash. When you're shooting video it can stay on to light up the scene. And on the front of iPhone 4, the built-in camera is perfect for making FaceTime calls and shooting self-portraits. While most phones have only one microphone, iPhone 4 has two. The main mic, located on the bottom next to the dock connector, is for phone calls, voice commands, and memos. The second mic, built into the top near the headphone jack, is for FaceTime calls and for making your phone calls better. It works with the main mic to suppress unwanted and distracting background sounds, such as music and loud conversations. This dual-mic noise suppression helps make every conversation a quiet one. With its large Multi-Touch display and innovative software, iPhone lets you control everything using just your fingers. How does it work? A panel laminated on the glass senses your touch using electrical fields. It can register multiple touches at once to support advanced gestures such as pinch to zoom, two-finger tap, and more. The panel then transmits the information to the Retina display below it.",

      "description":"iPhone 4S picks up where amazing left off. It's the fastest, most powerful iPhone ever. It features an 8-megapixel camera with all-new optics. It records stunning 1080p HD video. It comes with iOS 5 and iCloud. And it's the only phone with Siri - your intelligent assistant that helps you get things done, just by using your voice. Now you can use your voice to use your iPhone. Just talk to Siri as you would to a person: \"Do I need an umbrella? \" or \"Any great burgers around here? \" or \"Where's the closest ATM? \" Siri not only understands what you say, it knows what you mean. It figures out the right apps to use to find the right answer. Then, just like a personal assistant, it answers you. Siri makes phone calls, sends messages, schedules meetings, sets reminders, and more. How much more? Just ask, and Siri tells you that, too. Two cores in the A5 chip deliver up to two times more power and up to seven times faster graphics. And you'll feel the effects. Fast. iPhone 4S is quick and responsive, which makes all the difference when you're launching apps, browsing the web, gaming, and doing just about everything. And no matter what you're doing, you can keep on doing it. Because the A5 chip is so power-efficient, iPhone 4S has outstanding battery life. This just might be the best camera ever on a phone. And with all-new optics, it just might be the only camera you need. Because behind every shot, you've got 8-megapixel resolution and a custom lens with a larger f/2.4 aperture. Not to mention an improved backside illumination sensor, excellent auto white balance, advanced color accuracy, face detection, and reduced motion blur. It all means that no matter how many people, how much light, and how much action you capture, everything looks exactly as it should. And just wait until you see the photos. The iPhone 4S camera gives you 8 megapixels - that's 60 percent more pixels than the camera on iPhone 4. And they're engineered with a higher, full-well capacity to collect even more light. With more megapixels and more light, you'll see a dramatic difference in the resolution and details of your images. Shoot stunning 1080p HD video everywhere you go. With all-new optics, the light is always right, the color is always vivid, and everything will look even better than you remember. Video stabilization steadies shaky shots. And you can edit video right on iPhone and share your lush life as fast as you shoot. Record amazing 1080p HD video at 30 frames per second. The advanced backside illumination sensor and larger aperture let in even more light. Improved auto white balance makes color even more accurate. And temporal noise reduction helps you take great videos in low light. With every iOS advancement come even easier ways to do everything. That's what makes iOS years ahead of anything else. iOS 5 leaps even further ahead, bringing over 200 new features to iPhone 4S. iCloud is the easiest way to manage all your stuff, because it manages it all for you. iCloud stores your music, photos, apps, mail, contacts, calendars, documents, and more. And wirelessly pushes them to all your devices. It's automatic, effortless, and seamless. And it just works. With iCloud, the music you buy in iTunes appears automatically on all your devices. You can also download your past iTunes purchases. So your music collection goes where you go. The sharpest, most vibrant thing you'll see on iPhone 4S is everything. The Retina display is the highest-resolution phone screen ever. In fact, the pixel density is so high that the human eye is unable to distinguish individual pixels. But without a doubt, you'll notice crisp text, sharp graphics, and stunning images. It's more remarkable than the printed page. And you'll be completely absorbed. FaceTime lets you hear a voice and see the face that goes with it - iPhone to iPhone, iPad 2, iPod touch, or Mac over Wi-Fi.5 So no matter where they are, no matter where you are, you'll always be there. Making a FaceTime call is just as easy as making a phone call. And it's even easier with Siri. Just tell Siri \"FaceTime with Mom\" and you show up, smile, and wave hello. You'll never miss a big event, an important meeting, or a good laugh. And who wouldn't be happy to see your face? ",

      "description":"When Apple envisioned the iPhone, Apple landed on a remarkably thin and light design. But it's nearly impossible to make a device so thin and so light without sacrificing features or performance. Apple could have taken the easy way out and designed something more reasonable and less remarkable. But Apple didn't. If the technology didn't exist, Apple invented it. If a component wasn't small enough, Apple re-imagined it. If convention was standing in the way, Apple left it behind. The result is iPhone 5: the thinnest, lightest, fastest iPhone ever. iPhone 5 is just 7.6 millimeters thin. To make that happen, Apple engineers had to think small, component by component. They created a nano-SIM card, which is 44 percent smaller than a micro-SIM. They also developed a unique cellular solution for iPhone 5. The conventional approach to building LTE into a world phone uses two chips, one for voice, one for data. On iPhone 5, both are on a single chip. The intelligent, reversible Lightning connector is 80 percent smaller than the 30-pin connector. The 8-megapixel iSight camera has even more features, like panorama and dynamic low-light mode, yet it's 20 percent smaller. And the A6 chip is up to 2x faster than the A5 chip but 22 percent smaller.",

      "description":"Since time immemorial, color has been a tool of expression. An undeniable extension of who you are. And that's exactly why Apple brought it to iPhone. It's why they said no to thousands of seemingly acceptable colors before saying yes to five with uncommon beauty and depth. And why color is designed to permeate everything when you use iPhone 5c. From the way it looks. To the way it works. To the way it makes you feel. Because for color to truly be part of the experience, it can't simply be painted on. It has to be engineered in. The rich and particular color Apple wanted to infuse into iPhone 5c simply wasn't possible with metal. But Apple had no interest in imitating the typical, fragile plastic phone. So they built iPhone 5c around a steel-reinforced frame that also acts as an antenna. It's attached to the outer shell in individual pieces, then laser-welded together to achieve a precise fit. This structural integrity makes iPhone 5c pleasingly solid to the touch - unlike any plastic phone you've ever held. iPhone 5c feels as significant as it looks. Its appearance may be new, but the way iPhone 5c performs is instantly recognizable. That's because it has the things people loved about iPhone 5 inside. And more. The Apple-designed A6 chip delivers impressive performance and graphics. Yet it's incredibly energy efficient, so you can use your iPhone throughout the day without worrying about battery life. The 8MP iSight camera lets anyone anywhere take an amazing photo anytime. The 4-inch Retina display produces images with vivid clarity. And because iPhone 5c has more LTE wireless bands than ever before, LTE speeds are now a reality in even more places around the world. Launch your favorite apps. Load your favorite blog. Download and watch the jaw-dropping video that just showed up in your inbox. Power through games with console-level graphics. Do all the things you love doing on iPhone - at the speeds you've come to expect. The A6 chip is designed to be extremely energy efficient, so you can spend your day taking advantage of all the features and apps on your iPhone. Without worrying about battery life. The 8MP iSight camera delivers startlingly sharp photo quality thanks to features like a sophisticated five-element lens. And panorama, which lets you get stunning high-resolution shots of things like packed soccer stadiums. The San Francisco waterfront. Or the high school marching band your friend hired to play \"Happy Birthday\" outside your window. From the clean, thoughtfully redesigned icons, to the color-matched wallpapers that seem to radiate through the Home screen, color is everywhere in iOS 7. And that happened with full intent and purpose. iOS 7 was designed with the colors of iPhone 5c in mind. So using it feels not just more delightful, but also more personal. Equally noticeable are the ways in which iOS 7 brightens the tasks you perform every day. For example, it automatically organizes your photos for you, based on where and when you took each picture. You've always been able to send videos, documents, and contacts as attachments in email or texts. But now AirDrop lets you share them wirelessly and directly with people nearby. iOS 7 even enhances the experience of reading a web page as Safari recedes into the background, so you see more content and less browser. iOS 7 was designed to make the experience of using iPhone 5c more pleasant, more colorful, and even more fun.",

      "description":"You check your iPhone dozens and dozens of times a day, probably more. Entering a passcode each time just slows you down. But you do it because making sure no one else has access to your iPhone is important. With iPhone 5s, getting into your phone is faster, easier, and even a little futuristic. Touch ID is a fingerprint identity sensor. Put your finger on the Home button, and just like that your iPhone unlocks. It's a convenient and highly secure way to access your phone. Your fingerprint can also approve purchases from iTunes Store, the App Store, and the iBooks Store, so you don't have to enter your password. And Touch ID is capable of 360-degree readability. Which means no matter what its orientation - portrait, landscape, or anything in between - your iPhone reads your fingerprint and knows who you are. And because Touch ID lets you enroll multiple fingerprints, it knows the people you trust, too. There's fast. And then there's A7 fast. The A7 chip gives you CPU and graphics performance up to 2x faster than the A6 chip. Even more impressive, A7 makes iPhone 5s the first 64-bit smartphone in the world - that's desktop-class architecture in a superslim phone. And because iOS 7 was built specifically for 64-bit, it's uniquely designed to take advantage of the A7 chip. A7 supports OpenGL ES version 3.0 to deliver the kind of detailed graphics and complex visual effects once possible only on Mac computers, PCs, and gaming consoles. The difference is amazing. Take the imaginary worlds in games, for instance. Textures and shadows look more true to life. Sunlight reflects off the water. The whole experience feels much more realistic. iOS 7 and all the built-in apps are optimized for the A7 chip. The Camera app is a great example. It takes advantage of a new image signal processor built into A7 to give you up to 2x faster autofocus, faster photo capture, and higher video frame rates. The M7 coprocessor is like a sidekick to the A7 chip. It's designed specifically to measure motion data from the accelerometer, gyroscope, and compass - a task that would normally fall to the A7 chip. But M7 is much more efficient at it. Now fitness apps that track physical activity can access that data from the M7 coprocessor without constantly engaging the A7 chip. So they require less battery power. M7 knows when you're walking, running, or even driving. For example, Maps switches from driving to walking turn-by-turn navigation if, say, you park and continue on foot. Since M7 can tell when you're in a moving vehicle, iPhone 5s won't ask you to join Wi-Fi networks you pass by. And if your phone hasn't moved for a while, like when you're asleep, M7 reduces network pinging to spare your battery. iPhone 5 set a precedent. Apple engineers and designers managed to compress first-of-their-kind technologies inside a space that's a mere 7.6 millimeters thin and 112 grams light. A feat like that required designing or redesigning multiple components. And it resulted in an incredibly thin, impressively light, extraordinarily powerful smartphone. After coming so far with iPhone 5, it was a perfect place to start with iPhone 5s. And while the engineering challenge was significant, Apple succeeded in adding more to it without making iPhone 5s bigger or heavier. Noticeably faster performance and graphics that feel more true to life. That's the perennial goal when creating a new mobile chip. But performance shouldn't come at the expense of efficiency. Poor battery life for the sake of speed is never an option with iPhone. Which is why Apple engineered an all-new chip and an all-new coprocessor for iPhone 5s: A7 and M7. ",
